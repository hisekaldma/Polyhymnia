Polyhymnia
==========

Polyhymnia is a programming language for generative, interactive music. It lets you write rules that evaluate to patterns when played:

    Play -> A1 A2
    A1 => Piano: C D C G
    A2 => Piano: C C C C

Polyhymnia is still in the early stages of development, but you can [try it in the interactive playground](http://hisekaldma.github.io/Polyhymnia).
